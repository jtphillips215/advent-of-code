# advent-of-code

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language."

I've created this repository to hold my Advent of Code solutions. I typically use this to practice a new language or brush up on a language I'm unfamiliar with. Occasionally, I'll learn something new about the language I'm working in or a common computer science problem.

2021 solutions in Python. Started but did not finish.
2022 solutions in JavaScript and can be run using Node.

Went back to work day 4.
